Recommended YouTube Channel for solving tutorials: "NeetCode"

1. Standard Time for Solving LeetCode Problems:
   Easy: 15-20 minutes
   Medium: 30 minutes
   Hard: 40-60 minutes

# If you want to solve problems based on the patterns most frequently asked in tech company interviews, then "Blind 75 & NeetCode 150" are for you.

1. Blind 75: List of the 75 essential LeetCode algorithms problems.(Curated by Yangshun, a former Meta staff engineer)
   Easy: 19
   Medium: 49
   Hard: 7
2. NeetCode 150: Expands on Blind 75 with 75 more problems.
   Easy: 28
   Medium: 101
   Hard: 21

"Blind 75" vs "NeetCode 150" -> Blind 75 offers a solid foundation with essential LeetCode problems But "NeetCode 150" expands this palette, covering a wider array of patterns and topics!
